## the website (recommended)

[the website](https://tiredkangaroo.github.io/shipwrecked-shop) is better and much easier to use.

## using the terminal (if u dare)

go to `Latest Build` if you want to download binaries. run the binaries in a terminal.
you're going to have to bypass security warnings, especially on MacOS.

you could also just go install with (avoids security warnings):

```bash
go install github.com/tiredkangaroo/reverse-swshop
```

before you run, you're going to need to have an `items.json` in your folder. see below for how to get the data.

### find your user id

1. make sure you're signed into the [bay](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/bay)
2. go to [this](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/api/users/me) api endpoint in your browser
3. copy the `id` field under the `user` key from the json response

there you go, you have your user id

### find the items.json data

## questions

### how do u know this?

we do forward, guess-and-check-like, system to find the best times to buy. it ranges from now to every hour until the shop closes and calculates the price at each hour. then, it sorts them and gives you the best times to buy.

[the code](https://github.com/hackclub/shipwrecked/blob/main/lib/shop-utils.ts)

### why do u need items.json and user id?

they're used as part of the calculation. see the code linked above for more information.

### can i set reminders for the best times to buy?

not yet, but ill prolly add it soon.

### uh why are so many of the discounts 10%?

organized by best times to buy to worst. the best it can go is a 10% discount. it is highly likely that you will see a 10% discount, especially the further away you are from the end of the shop.

### can i get your autograph?

idk

### there's an error in the code

raise an issue or dm me (@aj), ur extremely cool for helping out üëç
